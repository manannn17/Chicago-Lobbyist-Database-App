# Chicago-Lobbyist-Database-App
The goal of this project is to write a console-based database application in Python, this 
time using an N-tier design. The database used for this project consists of information 
pertaining to registered lobbyists in Chicago, their employers, their clients, and their 
compensation.
The Chicago Lobbyist Database
A lobbyist is a person who tries to influence a politician or official group to write or vote 
on legislation in a particular way. In Chicago, the Board of Ethics regulates these 
individuals. They are required to register with the Board each year, and to file reports 
about their lobbying activities each quarter.
